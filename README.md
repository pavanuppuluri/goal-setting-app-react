To run this follow below steps

1. Clone the repo https://github.com/pavanuppuluri/goal-setting-app-react.git
2. Now open command prompt and go to goal-setting-app-react folder
3. Run npm install This command installs required dependencies from package.json
4. Run npm start

It should run the react application at http://localhost:3000

Some of the concepts I used in this application are -
* React **functional components**
* React **props**
* React **state**
* React **event handling**
* Validations
* **Styling**
* **JavaScript**

Happy Coding!!!
